"""DolphinLitePark MaaS platform video generation tool.

Calls the internal MaaS gateway at /v1/video/generations using an async
polling pattern. Supports text-to-video, image-to-video, reference-to-video
and video-edit across 17 models from Volcengine Seedance, DashScope Wan /
HappyHorse, H100/LTX, H100/Wan2.2 and the fanya alias.

Gateway base URL: https://api.aiapbot.com (override via MAAS_API_BASE)
Auth:            Authorization: Bearer <MAAS_API_KEY>

Reference-image field names are NOT uniform across model families (per
docs/multimodal-call-guide-v4.md) — sending the wrong field name for a model
doesn't error, it just silently drops the reference, so this matters more
than it looks:
  - leapfast/ltx-2.3, leapfast/wan2.2: `image` (base64/data-uri, preferred)
    | `image_url` (public URL) | `image_base64` (explicit, highest
    priority) — mutually exclusive.
  - happyhorse-1.0-i2v / -r2v: `image` (URL only, >=300x300px) — note this
    is a URL despite sharing a field name with LTX/Wan2.2's base64 field.
  - volcengine Seedance family: no standard-DTO image field is documented
    at all — only a native-passthrough `content: [...]` array (see
    MaasVideo._build_payload). Also: image_to_video/reference_to_video for
    this family must NOT include duration_seconds, or the upstream
    Volcengine API rejects it with InvalidParameter (400).
