"""Video composition tool — FFmpeg + Remotion + HyperFrames (runtime-aware).

Pipeline-facing orchestration surface for composition. Takes `edit_decisions`,
`asset_manifest`, and audio, and delegates to the technical runtime chosen
at proposal stage.

Routing is driven by `edit_decisions.render_runtime` (locked at proposal):

- `remotion`   → React-based frame-accurate render via `npx remotion render`.
                 Handles the existing scene-component stack, word-level captions,
                 TalkingHead/CinematicRenderer. Current default.
- `hyperframes` → HTML/CSS/GSAP render via `hyperframes_compose`.
                 Handles kinetic typography, product promos, website-to-video,
                 registry blocks. Added in the parallel-runtime initiative.
- `ffmpeg`     → FFmpeg concat/trim. Used only for simple video cuts without
                 composition, or when the approved path explicitly names FFmpeg.

Authoring mode is orthogonal to runtime. Setting
`edit_decisions.composition_mode = "atelier"` (or `renderer_family="bespoke"`)
means the composition is hand-authored rather than assembled from stock scene
components. Runtime still wins first: HyperFrames atelier routes through
`hyperframes_compose`, FFmpeg stays FFmpeg-only, and only Remotion atelier uses
`_render_via_atelier` for a project-local Remotion entry that bypasses the
cut-schema and stock scene-type registry.

Silent runtime swaps are forbidden by governance. If the chosen runtime is
unavailable or fails, this tool surfaces a structured blocker and waits for
the agent to re-ask the user rather than substituting a different engine.
