# Edit Director - Animation Pipeline

## When To Use

This stage turns the scene plan into an animatic-grade edit plan. Timing is the product.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/edit_decisions.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | `state.artifacts["assets"]["asset_manifest"]`, `state.artifacts["scene_plan"]["scene_plan"]`, `state.artifacts["script"]["script"]` | Assets, timing plan, and beats |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Motion and typography rules |

## Process

### 0. Carry `render_runtime` Forward Unchanged

`render_runtime` was locked at proposal as a plain string — `"remotion"`,
`"hyperframes"`, or `"ffmpeg"` — nothing else. Copy it into
`edit_decisions.render_runtime` byte-for-byte. Do NOT restructure it into an
object (e.g. `{engine, fps, resolution, ...}`) — that fabricates data the
schema rejects (`is not of type 'string'`) and trips the render-runtime
consistency guard, failing the job outright. Delivery specs like
resolution/fps/aspect_ratio/output format are NOT part of this field; they
belong to the compose stage's `profile`/`output_profile` selection (see
`compose-director.md` and `lib/media_profiles.py`), not to `render_runtime`.
Changing the runtime requires a logged `render_runtime_selection` decision —
never silently.

Two sibling proposal-locked fields need the same treatment — confirmed live
(a full paid end-to-end run): `renderer_family` was absent from
`edit_decisions` entirely, forcing the compose agent to guess and patch it
in mid-render as a "data-completion fix". `composition_mode` was silently
dropped too, which defeated the atelier/templated routing check in
`video_compose._render` (`composition_mode == "atelier"`), silently
downgrading an intended atelier render to the templated `cuts[]` path
instead. Copy both forward unchanged from `production_plan.renderer_family`
/ `production_plan.composition_mode` into `edit_decisions.renderer_family` /
`edit_decisions.composition_mode` — same rule as `render_runtime`: no
inventing, no omitting, no restructuring.

### 1. Protect Hold Time

After key reveals, plan enough time for the viewer to process the frame. Do not stack every scene edge to edge with motion.

### 2. Stagger Secondary Elements

Primary element first, supporting elements second. The edit decisions should reinforce hierarchy.

### 3. Keep Motion Meaningful

Motion should signal:

- emphasis,
- transition,
- transformation,
- contrast.

### 4. Use Metadata For Timing Detail

Recommended metadata keys:

- `hold_windows`
- `stagger_rules`
- `transition_map`
- `scene_timing_notes`

### 5. Quality Gate

- key information has enough dwell time,
- movement clarifies hierarchy,
- transitions stay consistent,
- the edit remains readable on the target platform.

## Common Pitfalls

- Overcrowding the timeline with continuous motion.
- Revealing all elements at once.
- Letting stylistic motion reduce readability.
