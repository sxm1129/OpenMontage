# Edit Director - Hybrid Pipeline

## When To Use

This stage creates the layered edit logic for a source-led video with support elements. The order matters: anchor cut first, support layers second.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/edit_decisions.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | `state.artifacts["assets"]["asset_manifest"]`, `state.artifacts["scene_plan"]["scene_plan"]`, `state.artifacts["script"]["script"]` | Source/support assets and timeline intent |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Typography and motion consistency |

## Process

### 0. Carry `render_runtime` Forward Unchanged

`render_runtime` was locked at proposal as a plain string — `"remotion"`,
`"hyperframes"`, or `"ffmpeg"` — nothing else. Copy it into
`edit_decisions.render_runtime` byte-for-byte. Do NOT restructure it into an
object (e.g. `{engine, fps, resolution, ...}`) — that fabricates data the
schema rejects (`is not of type 'string'`) and trips the render-runtime
consistency guard, failing the job outright. Delivery specs like
resolution/fps/aspect_ratio/output format are NOT part of this field; they
belong to the compose stage's `profile`/`output_profile` selection (see
`compose-director.md` and `lib/media_profiles.py`), not to `render_runtime`.
Changing the runtime requires a logged `render_runtime_selection` decision —
never silently.

### 1. Lock The Anchor Cut First

The viewer should understand the story before support overlays are added. If the anchor cut is weak, support layers will not save it.

### 2. Add Support In Priority Order

Typical order:

1. subtitles,
2. speaker or context labels,
3. diagrams or stat cards,
4. optional inserts,
5. CTA elements.

### 3. Protect Readability

Never stack too many support layers in one moment. If subtitles, labels, charts, and overlays collide, simplify.

### 4. Use Metadata For Layering Logic

Recommended metadata keys:

- `anchor_cut_notes`
- `layer_order`
- `overlay_windows`
- `variant_edit_rules`

### 5. Quality Gate

- the anchor cut works on its own,
- support layers clarify instead of distract,
- mobile readability survives,
- variants remain consistent.

## Common Pitfalls

- Trying to fix a weak cut with extra graphics.
- Letting support layers compete with the source.
- Building each platform variant as a separate editorial philosophy.
