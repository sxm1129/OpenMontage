"""SSE stream: regular replay, and the terminal-state synthesis fix.

Regression: a job interrupted by a server restart (marked failed by
JobStore._load_all) never had a job_failed event appended to its persisted
log — its last real event stayed whatever it was mid-flight (e.g.
awaiting_approval). A (re)connecting client would drain history, see the
stream close with no terminal event, and — per page.tsx's onerror handler —
reconnect forever, stuck showing the stale "awaiting_approval" state with no
visible next action. The fix: synthesize a terminal event whenever a client
(re)connects to a job that is already terminal but has no new events to drain.
