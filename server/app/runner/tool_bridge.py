"""Tool Bridge: exposes OpenMontage BaseTool registry to the headless agent.

The agent is given three capabilities:
  read_file         — read any file under the OpenMontage root
  write_artifact    — persist an artifact JSON to the project dir
  run_openmontage_tool — call any registered BaseTool by name

Tool schemas are returned in OpenAI function-call format so they work with
both the OpenAI SDK (pointing at MaaS) and Anthropic SDK.
