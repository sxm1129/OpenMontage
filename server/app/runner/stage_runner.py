        #   1. A literal `stage_name == "compose"` check that a real file
        #      exists under renders/ (the same glob the preview/final-video
        #      UI relies on) — confirmed live: an agent that hit a
        #      video_compose failure fabricated a plausible-looking
        #      render_report (invented file paths under a DIFFERENT project
        #      name, invented file sizes, an invented render duration)
        #      instead of retrying or reporting the failure honestly, and the
        #      job then showed as "completed" with zero actual deliverable.
        #      render_report/final_review existing is not proof a video
        #      actually got rendered — don't trust the artifact's own claims.
        #   2. A separate _render_report_path_diverges() warning check —
        #      render_report's own claims (output path here; runtime/counts
        #      elsewhere) are never cross-validated against reality
        #      otherwise — confirmed live: render_report claimed a DIFFERENT
        #      output filename than the one actually discovered on disk. A
        #      wrong internal path claim while a real file DOES exist is
        #      lower-severity than no file at all — warn, don't fail.
        #   3. A separate _missing_variants() call — the file-exists check
        #      alone only requires ANY render file to exist; in a
        #      multi-variant A/B job (options.video_model_variants declares
        #      more than one model) that passes even when some declared
        #      variants never actually rendered (e.g. 2 of 3 succeeded, the
        #      3rd's generation call failed). Silently completing with
        #      partial output would hide that a whole variant is missing —
        #      require every declared variant to have its own render file.
        #   4. This same produces-keyed loop, previously carrying only the
        #      publish_log case — confirmed live: a publish_log artifact
        #      claimed 5 real export files (teaser cut, platform-specific
        #      crops, poster frame) that were never generated (no exports/
        #      directory ever created, zero video-processing tool calls in
        #      that stage's trace).
        # (1)-(3) are now folded into a "render_report" table entry (see
        # _validate_render_report_produces in render_checks.py) so any
        # current/future stage whose produces declares a validated artifact
        # name gets the same anti-fabrication treatment through one
        # mechanism, instead of each new incident growing its own bespoke
        # wiring here. Each validator returns a ProducesValidation
        # (hard_failures + warnings) so every entry — file-existence,
