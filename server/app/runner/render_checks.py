"""Render discovery and produces-vs-reality validators for the stage runner.

Split out of stage_runner.py: everything here is a stateless leaf function
(project_dir / an artifact dict / options in, a Path/str/ProducesValidation
out) with no orchestration dependencies — no job_store, no LLM client, no
nonlocal closures over pipeline state. `_check_render_runtime_consistency`
(the edit-vs-proposal render_runtime check) deliberately stayed behind in
stage_runner.py — it's a different check family (consistency between two
artifacts, not an artifact's claims vs. what's actually on disk) and isn't
one of the _PRODUCES_EXPORT_VALIDATORS entries this module owns.

Re-imported back into stage_runner.py's own namespace (see its import block)
so every existing call site in that file, and every direct
`from app.runner.stage_runner import _discover_render_url, ...` in the test
suite, keeps working unchanged — this is pure code motion, not a behavior
change.
