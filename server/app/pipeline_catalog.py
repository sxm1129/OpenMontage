"""Pipeline manifest access for the web platform.

Wraps the engine's strict loader but degrades to a lenient raw YAML read when a
manifest fails schema validation (some engine manifests have drifted from the
schema — e.g. a category value or an extra key). This keeps every pipeline in
pipeline_defs/ runnable and listable from the web platform without editing the
engine's manifests, while still preferring strict validation when it passes.
