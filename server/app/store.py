"""Durable job store for v1.

Filesystem-first (no DB): job records are written through to
projects/.jobstore/<job_id>.json and events to an append-only
<job_id>.events.jsonl. On startup the store rehydrates from disk so a server
restart no longer wipes jobs — the retry endpoint keeps working and in-flight
jobs that were interrupted by the restart are surfaced as failed+retryable.
