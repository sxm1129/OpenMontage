"""Regression: maas_video.execute() must reject an operation the chosen
model doesn't support BEFORE making the paid API call, not silently drop
the image_url/reference and return a normal-looking text-to-video clip.

Found live: leapfast/ltx-2.3 is declared "ops": ["t2v"] only, but a
multi-shot character-consistency pass could request image_to_video/
reference_to_video against it with no error — the reference is silently
ignored, and the mismatch only surfaces as visibly inconsistent output
across shots after paying for all of them.
